project ( 4 top level entities)

when logging exceptions also log traceback

value object -> short living immutale object (DTO - data transfer object)
entities -> (long living object persisting in db)
aggregate -> object that can live on its own without depending on other objects
boundery context -> separate module (user management, order management etc) that can be developed separately
repositories -> life cycle logic (CRUD)
services -> business logic (controllers from MVC)

design patterns

povedencheski -> mvvm observer{eventlistener}
